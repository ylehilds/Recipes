# Recipes (iOS)

A native iOS app for **browsing, viewing, and organizing cooking recipes**. The app provides a simple list â†’ detail flow where users can explore a collection of recipes, view details such as ingredients and instructions, and manage their own favorites or custom entries.

This project demonstrates clean iOS app structure, Swift best practices, and separation of concerns with dedicated unit and UI test targets.
